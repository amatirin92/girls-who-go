        <p class="quote">"Words can't even begin to describe how much fun I had! I went to Venice, Italy last summer and it was literally the best experience of my life! Thanks GWG! <3"</p>
		<img class='testimonals' src='assets/img/testimonial.png'>
		<p class="author">— Amy Tanaka - Los Angeles, CA</p>

        <p class="quote">"At first I was nervous because I had never left Europe before, but I'm so glad I went. I went to Miami and I couldn't be more pleased! Lisa, our coordinator, was very friendly and helpful with everything, especially when I had a slight problem with my visa. I also met wonderful girls. One girl became my best friend and was my maid of honor at my wedding!"</p>
        <img class='testimonals' src='assets/img/testimonal2.png'>
		<p class="author">— Heidi Schmidt - Munich, Germany</p>

		<p class="quote">"WOW. WOW. WOW. I went kayaking for the first time in my life, got to windsurf, went hiking and even went skateboarding. I would've never thought to do such different activities, but I felt supported enough to give it a try. If you've never done such activities, PLEASE travel with Girls Who Go! You will NOT regret it!"</p>
